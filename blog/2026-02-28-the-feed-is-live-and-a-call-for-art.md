OK!  Gage from IRWT was kind enough to provide me a list of current blogs to get started, and the basic site feed has been implemented.  Thanks to him for his effort getting that list together.  I will now start to look for any improvements that can be made to loading speed on the main index, as well as starting to put together the page for some of the most legendary and influential blogs in the hobby.



Anyone who would like to contribute in anyway can reach me on discord and instagram @wyrdstoned or email me- wyrdstoned@gmail.com.

I would like to add some a background image or artwork down the margins of the site, a logo/icon, and possibly a header image.  If thats something youre interested in please reach out.

Thank you for looking,

Paul
