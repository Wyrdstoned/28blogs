<p>28Blogs serves as an aggregation point for blogs and YouTube channels pertaining to narrative wargaming and hobbying in The Grimdark Style.</p>

<p>The rapid proliferation of social media networks led to a dramatic reduction and closure of the forums and long form blogs that were a crucial foundation of the hobby.  Initially, this allowed many hobbyists to find each other and new communities formed there. The recent enshitification and algorithmic content presentation has led many who started or returned to the hobby during the Covid-19 era to begin blogging again. News of privacy invasion on the horizon from Discord looks to be another breaking point.</p>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/3CrDk4WX">The In Rust We Trust Discord server</a> has done an incredible job of collecting and presenting many of the active blogs that are part of this new resurgence. The list curated there will serve as a jumping off point for this project. I also wanted to highlight some of the now defunct blogs that were fundamental to the development of this modeling and painting style.</p>

<p>This project would not be possible without the help of Painter and SteveJ, thank you so much.</p>

<p>I would be remiss not to mention the Wier brothers from the blog <a href="https://www.betweenthebolterandme.com/">Between the Bolter and Me</a>, who knows where we would be without them. I would also like to thank:</p>
